# Software Development Worksheet (SDW)

* **Course:** IT 140 - *Introduction to Scripting*
* **Activity:** 2-3: Module Two Assignment
* **Program:** `name_age`

> Use this worksheet as working notes while you move through the **Analyze** and **Design** phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
>
> Your notes do not need to be formal or polished. Keep your answers brief and write them in your own words. The purpose of the SDW is to help you understand the requirements and provided design before you begin constructing your program.
>
> Look for **TODO** comments in the SDW. Replace them with your own answers. Do not leave any **TODO** comments in your final SDW.
>
> **This worksheet is not a deliverable.** Do not submit it in D2L Brightspace for grading.

## How to Use This Worksheet

> The worksheet uses the same pattern throughout:
>
> * Instructions and background information appear in blockquotes like this one.
> * **Where to look** tells you exactly where to find the information you need.
> * **Prompt** tells you what to think about or answer.
> * Your responses go in the blank space immediately after each prompt.
>
> **Text outside the blockquotes is your work.** Enter your responses as regular text in your own words.

## Analyze Phase

**SDLC progress:** [0 Start Here](./README.md) → **1 Analyze** → [2 Design](./design/README.md) → [3 Construct](./src/README.md) → [4 Test](./tests/README.md) → [5 Submit](https://learn.snhu.edu/)

> During the Analyze phase, focus on **what the program must do**. Use the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) as your primary source.

### 1. Review the Requirements

> Before completing the Analyze sections of this worksheet, review:
>
> * [ ] [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](./analysis/name_age_srs.md)
>   * `## 0. General Description`
>   * `## 1. Functional Requirements`
>   * `## 2. Nonfunctional Requirements`
>   * `## 3. Technology Constraints`
>   * `## 4. Quality of Service Constraints`
>   * `## Sample Input and Output`
>   * `## Acceptance Test Cases`

### 2. Program Purpose

> In one sentence, summarize the program's purpose **in your own words**.
>
> Do not copy the SRS or ask AI to generate your answer. You will use your understanding of the program's purpose when you write the documentation string (docstring) in your Python program.
>
> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 0. General Description`
>
> **Prompt:** What is this program supposed to do for its user?
>
> Enter your response below.

TODO: Replace this text with your one-sentence summary of the program's purpose

### 3. Inputs, Processing, and Outputs

> Think about the solution as three basic parts:
>
> **Input → Processing → Output** or **IPO**

#### IPO: Inputs

> Inputs are not limited to information a user types. They also include values the program obtains from system information or values it sets internally.
>
> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 0. General Description` and `## 1. Functional Requirements`, especially requirements **1.1–1.4**
>
> **Prompt:** What information does the program receive or obtain? Identify each input or internally obtained value the program needs and where it comes from.
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each input.

1. TODO: Replace with your first input and its source (e.g., user input, system value, internal value).

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements`, especially requirement **1.3**
>
> **Prompt:** For each input you listed above, what data type (e.g., string, integer, float)does each input need? If the SRS does not specify one, write **Not specified**.
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each input.

1. TODO: Replace with your first input and its data type (e.g., string, integer, float, Not specified).

#### IPO: Processing

> Processing describes what the program must do with its inputs to produce the desired output.
>
> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 0. General Description` and `## 1. Functional Requirements`, especially requirements **1.3–1.4**
>
> **Prompt:** What must happen to the inputs before the program produces its output?
>
> Enter a brief description in your own words below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each process.

1. TODO: Replace with your first processing step in your own words.

#### IPO: Outputs

> Outputs are the information or results the program produces.
>
> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements`, especially requirement **1.5**
>
> **Prompt:** What information must the program produce, and where is it displayed?
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each output.

1. TODO: Replace with your first output and where it is displayed (e.g., console, file, GUI).

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements`, requirement **1.5**, and `## Sample Input and Output`
>
> **Prompt:** Does the output need to follow a particular format? If so, describe the required format.
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each output format.

1. TODO: Replace with your first output format.

### 4. Requirements in My Own Words

> A few important requirements from the SRS are listed below. For each one, briefly explain **in your own words** what the requirement means.
>
> Do not copy the requirement or ask AI to generate your answer. The goal is to make sure you understand what the program must do before you begin constructing it.

#### SRS Requirement 1.2 — Get the User's Age

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.2**
>
> **Prompt:** What does requirement 1.2 mean in your own words?
>
> Enter your response below in your own words.

Replace this text with your explanation of requirement 1.2 in your own words.

#### SRS Requirement 1.3 — Use the Age in an Arithmetic Calculation

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.3**
>
> **Prompt:** What does requirement 1.3 mean in your own words?
>
> Enter your response below in your own words.

TODO: Replace this text with your explanation of requirement 1.3 in your own words.

#### SRS Requirement 1.4 — Calculate the Approximate Birth Year

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.4**
>
> **Prompt:** What does requirement 1.4 mean in your own words?
>
> Enter your response below.

Replace this text with your explanation of requirement 1.4 in your own words.

#### SRS Requirement 1.5 — Display the Personalized Result

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.5**
>
> **Prompt:** What does requirement 1.5 mean in your own words?
>
> Enter your response below.

TODO: Replace this text with your explanation of requirement 1.5 in your own words.

### 5. Constraints and Special Cases

> Requirements can include more than what a program does. They can also specify how the program should be written, where it should run, and what conditions it must handle.

#### Important Constraints

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 2. Nonfunctional Requirements`, `## 3. Technology Constraints`, and `## 4. Quality of Service Constraints`
>
> **Prompt:** Identify two or three important constraints you need to remember when constructing or testing the program.
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each constraint.

1. TODO: Replace with your first important constraint.

#### Special or Edge Cases

> An **edge case** uses an unusual or boundary value that can help reveal problems in a solution.
>
> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## Acceptance Test Cases`, especially the tests identified as edge cases
>
> **Prompt:** What edge cases will be used to test the program?
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each edge case.

1. TODO: Replace with your first edge case.

### 6. Analyze Checkpoint

> Before continuing to the Design phase, make sure:
>
> * [ ] I can explain the program's purpose in my own words.
> * [ ] I identified the program's inputs, processing, and outputs.
> * [ ] I understand the selected functional requirements.
> * [ ] I identified important constraints and edge cases.
> * [ ] I did not add requirements that are not stated in the SRS.
>
> When these checks are complete, continue to the [Design phase](./design/README.md).

## Design Phase

**SDLC progress:** [0 Start Here](./README.md) → [1 Analyze](./analysis/README.md) → **2 Design** → [3 Construct](./src/README.md) → [4 Test](./tests/README.md) → [5 Submit](https://learn.snhu.edu/)

> During the Design phase, focus on **how the program will meet the requirements**. The design has already been provided for you. Your job is to understand it well enough to use it when you construct the program.

### 7. Review the Design

> Before completing the Design sections of this worksheet, review:
>
> * [ ] [Software Design Document (SDD)](./design/name_age_sdd.md)
>   * `## 2. Solution Overview`
>   * `## 4. Data Design`
>   * `## 5. Interface and Input/Output Design`
>   * `## 6. Program Logic and Control Flow`
>   * `### 6.1 Main Processing Steps`
> * [ ] [Flowchart](./design/name_age.drawio) → **Flowchart** page; follow the path from **Start** to **End**
> * [ ] [Pseudocode](./design/name_age.pseudo) → read the algorithm from **START name_age** through **END name_age**
>
> Remember:
>
> **SRS = what the program must do**
>
> **SDD, flowchart, and pseudocode = how the program is planned to do it**

### 8. Connect Requirements to the Design

> The SRS describes **what** the program must do. The design shows **how** the planned solution will meet those requirements.
>
> For each requirement below, find where the provided design addresses it.

#### SRS Requirement 1.3

> **Where to look:**
>
> * [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.3**
> * [Pseudocode](./design/name_age.pseudo)
> * [Flowchart](./design/name_age.drawio)
>
> **Prompt:** What part of the design addresses this requirement? Briefly explain the connection.
>
> Enter your response below.

TODO: Replace this text with your explanation of how the design addresses requirement 1.3.

#### SRS Requirement 1.4

> **Where to look:**
>
> * [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.4**
> * [Pseudocode](./design/name_age.pseudo)
> * [Flowchart](./design/name_age.drawio)
>
> **Prompt:** What part of the design addresses this requirement? Briefly explain the connection.
>
> Enter your response below.

TODO: Replace this text with your explanation of how the design addresses requirement 1.4.

### 9. Check the Plan With an Example

> Before writing Python code, follow the planned solution by hand using one provided test case.
>
> For this activity, use **Test 1: Typical adult age**.

#### Test Input

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## Acceptance Test Cases` → **Test 1. Typical adult age**
>
> **Prompt:** Record the current year, name, and age from Test 1.
>
> Enter your response below.

* Current year: TODO: Replace with the current year from Test 1.
* User name: TODO: Replace with the user name from Test 1.
* User age: TODO: Replace with the user age from Test 1.

#### Test Processing

> **Where to look:**
>
> * [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements` → requirement **1.4**
> * [SDD](./design/name_age_sdd.md) → `## 6. Program Logic and Control Flow`
> * [Pseudocode](./design/name_age.pseudo) → the step that calculates the birth year
>
> **Prompt:** Show the birth-year calculation using the Test 1 values.
>
> Enter your calculation below.

User's approximate birth year = TODO: Replace with the calculation using the Test 1 values (e.g., current year - user age).

#### Expected Output

> **Where to look:** [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## Acceptance Test Cases` → **Test 1. Typical adult age**
>
> **Prompt:** Record the expected output for Test 1.
>
> Enter your response below.

Expected output for Test 1:

> Compare your hand-calculated result with the expected result:
>
> * [ ] My result matches the expected result.
> * [ ] My result does not match. I need to review the SRS and design before continuing.

### 10. Questions or Unclear Information

> Before constructing the program, make sure the requirements and design make sense together.
>
> If something seems missing, unclear, or inconsistent, record it here rather than guessing.
>
> **Where to look:** Compare:
>
> * [SRS](./analysis/name_age_srs.md) → `## 1. Functional Requirements`
> * [SDD](./design/name_age_sdd.md) → `## 2. Solution Overview` through `## 6. Program Logic and Control Flow`
> * [Flowchart](./design/name_age.drawio) → **Flowchart** page
> * [Pseudocode](./design/name_age.pseudo) → **START name_age** through **END name_age**
>
> **Prompt:** Did you find any question, unclear requirement, or difference between the requirements and design? If everything is clear and consistent, enter **None**.
>
> Enter your response below. Use a separate numbered bullet for each question or unclear item.

1. TODO: Replace with your first question or unclear item, or enter **None** if everything is clear.

> If you cannot resolve a repository or course-IDE question, use the [Module Two Assignment GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GC-STEM/it140-m2-assignment/discussions). Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GC-STEM/it140-m2-assignment/issues) to report a technical problem with the provided repository files or tools. Contact your instructor through D2L Brightspace for questions about assignment requirements, grading, or feedback.

### 11. Ready to Construct

> Your analysis and design notes will help you complete the provided Python starter file.
>
> Before continuing, open [`name_age.py`](./src/name_age.py) and notice how your SDW work connects to the starter code:
>
> * Your **Program Purpose** notes will help with the first line of the module docstring.
> * Your **Inputs, Processing, and Outputs** notes will help with the `Input:`, `Process:`, and `Output:` sections of the module docstring.
> * Your **Plan the Solution** notes will help you understand the Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 placeholders in `main()`.
> * Your understanding of the **SRS requirements** will help you determine whether your completed code does what is required.
>
> **Where to look:** [Starter Code](./src/name_age.py) → the module docstring at the top of the file and the TODO comments inside `main()`
>
> Before continuing to the Construct phase, make sure:
>
> * [ ] I can explain what the program must accomplish.
> * [ ] I understand its inputs, processing, and outputs.
> * [ ] I understand the major steps in the provided design.
> * [ ] I checked the design using a provided acceptance test case.
> * [ ] I recorded or resolved anything that was unclear.
> * [ ] I am ready to use the starter code to construct the program.
>
> When these checks are complete, continue to the [Construct phase](./src/README.md).

<!-- Scaffolding Notes

This SDW provides substantial guidance because Module Two is the student's first course assignment using the simplified SDLC.

Student-facing formatting convention:

* Instructional and background text appears inside blockquotes.
* "Where to look" identifies the exact provided source for the information students need.
* "Prompt" identifies the task students should answer.
* Student responses are entered as regular, unformatted text outside the blockquotes.
* Do not use {{double-brace placeholders}} for student responses. Reserve {{double braces}} for developer/maintainer prompts that must be replaced before publication.

As students progress through IT 140, scaffolding can be reduced while preserving the Analyze → Design → Construct workflow.

Possible scaffold reduction:

* Early course:
  * Provide exact file and section references for each task.
  * Separate Input, Processing, and Output prompts.
  * Select 2–4 SRS requirements for students to explain.
  * Provide guided solution-plan prompts.
  * Select a test case for students to trace.
  * Provide detailed Analyze and Ready to Construct checkpoints.

* Middle course:
  * Keep file and section references but reduce explanatory text.
  * Combine IPO prompts.
  * Reduce the number of guided solution-plan questions.
  * Allow students to choose which provided test case to trace.
  * Shorten phase checkpoints.

* Late course:
  * Point students to the appropriate source documents without identifying every section.
  * Ask students to identify the most important requirements themselves.
  * Replace detailed IPO prompts with a concise data-flow summary.
  * Use a largely free-form solution plan.
  * Ask students to select an appropriate test case to trace.
  * Use minimal phase checkpoints.
